    "### 9. Explain the concept of variable scope in Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variable scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of a program, particularly within functions. The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions introduce their own scope, and variables defined within a function have local scope by default. This means that they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined. However, Python also allows variables to be defined outside of any function, in what is known as the global scope. Global variables can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program, including within functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key points about variable scope in Python functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Scope**: Variables defined within a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including within functions. They exist for the entire duration of the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Variables**: Functions can access variables defined in the global scope, but they cannot modify them directly unless explicitly specified using the `global` keyword. This ensures that functions do not unintentionally modify global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shadowing**: If a variable with the same name is defined both globally and locally within a function, the local variable \"shadows\" the global variable, meaning the local variable takes precedence within the function. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and should be avoided for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variable scope is essential for writing maintainable and bug-free Python code, as it helps prevent unintended modifications to variables and ensures proper encapsulation of code. It also allows for better organization and separation of concerns within programs.\n"

    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. In other words, a recursive function is one that calls itself within its own definition. Recursion is based on the principle of divide and conquer, where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems that are easier to solve, and the solutions to these subproblems are combined to solve the original problem.\n",

    "### 15. How do you use regular expressions to find patterns within strings in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the `re` module to work with regular expressions and find patterns within strings. The `re` module provides several functions for pattern matching, including `re.search()`, `re.findall()`, and `re.match()`, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a general overview of how you can use regular expressions to find patterns within strings in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the `re` module**: Start by importing the `re` module, which provides support for working with regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define a regular expression pattern**: Define a regular expression pattern that represents the pattern you want to search for within the string. Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use the appropriate `re` function**: Choose the appropriate function from the `re` module based on your requirements. For example:\n",
    "   - Use `re.search()` to search for a pattern anywhere within the string.\n",
    "   - Use `re.findall()` to find all occurrences of a pattern within the string.\n",
    "   - Use `re.match()` to match a pattern only at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "   - Use other functions like `re.finditer()` for more advanced pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply the function to the string**: Pass the regular expression pattern and the string to the chosen `re` function. The function will return a match object or a list of match objects representing the occurrences of the pattern within the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example demonstrating how to use regular expressions to find patterns within strings in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",

The `asyncio` module provides coroutines, tasks, and event loops for writing asynchronous code that can perform I/O operations concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improve scalability and performance**: By leveraging asynchronous I/O, applications can achieve better scalability and performance by handling a large number of I/O-bound operations efficiently. Asynchronous programming reduces the need for threads or processes, which can be resource-intensive and less scalable, especially in I/O-bound scenarios.\n",

    "### 50. What is the purpose of the argparse module in Python, and how is it used for parsing command-line arguments?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `argparse` module in Python provides a convenient way to parse command-line arguments passed to a Python script and convert them into a structured form. It simplifies the process of handling command-line arguments by automatically generating help messages, validating inputs, and providing a consistent interface for accessing parsed arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the purpose of the `argparse` module is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse command-line arguments**: The `argparse` module allows developers to define the expected command-line arguments, including their names, types, default values, and help messages. It automatically parses the command-line arguments passed to the script and converts them into Python objects for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate help messages**: The `argparse` module automatically generates help messages and usage instructions based on the defined command-line arguments. This helps users understand how to use the script and provides guidance on the available options and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validate inputs**: `argparse` performs validation of command-line arguments, such as ensuring that required arguments are provided, checking the types and values of arguments, and handling errors gracefully. This helps prevent invalid inputs and provides feedback to users when errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide a consistent interface**: `argparse` provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for accessing parsed command-line arguments. It allows developers to access arguments by their names and provides methods for accessing individual arguments or groups of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of how the `argparse` module is used for parsing command-line arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the argparse module**: First, you need to import the `argparse` module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create an ArgumentParser object**: Instantiate an `ArgumentParser` object to define the expected command-line arguments and configure parsing behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define command-line arguments**: Add arguments to the `ArgumentParser` object using methods such as `add_argument()` to specify the names, types, default values, and help messages of the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parse command-line arguments**: Call the `parse_args()` method of the `ArgumentParser` object to parse the command-line arguments passed to the script. This method returns a namespace or dictionary containing the parsed arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Access parsed arguments**: Access the parsed arguments using attributes of the returned namespace object or keys of the returned dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example demonstrating how the `argparse` module is used for parsing command-line arguments:\n",
